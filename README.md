# 325-project2
Run "python changetest.py test.txt"

This will run the test of V = [1, 2, 4, 8] and A = 15 for only the DP and Greedy algorithms. 

The output files will be test-change-slow.txt, test-change-dp.txt, and test-change-greedy.txt

In the output files, we have also included the running time in microseconds to calculate each test. 

The raw information used for answers 4, 5, and 6 can be found in project2.xlsx (Note, the graphs look funny because the timing information is not hidden. To see the graphs correctly, hide columns C and E).
